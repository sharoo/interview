# Level 3

## Goal

The goal is to find a vehicle that is available for a given time and return it with a calculated pricing.

## Explanation

You find in `data.json` bookings, vehicle availabilities and vehicle pricings. Use the `data.json` together with `input.json` to generate `output.json`. Your code should be found in `main.rb`.

## Calculations

Use your price calculations from level 1. A vehicle is available if it has availabilities for the time given in `input.json`. Also there should be no other booking for the same vehicle in the given time.
